# audit
Powershell software and hardware audit of remote PCs

This code is largely based on an auditing program I found on one of the scripting sites. Unfortunately there was no
original author information that I could find. When I do locate it I'll update the master branch with the original 
author's details.

A number of changes are needed to this to suit my particular situation, and no doubt that of anyone who decised to
use it - modularising it is one of my goals to make this easier.
