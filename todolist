Changes needed, in no particular order

* Change:     Remove non-US keyboards, or at least comment them out
  Rationale:  I only use a US (International) keyboard so why complicate things by having
              to lookup keyboard types. I recognise that others are not native English 
              speakers, so these need to be commented out so they can be restored at a later date

* Change:     Better handling of non-responsive machines
  Rationale:  Currently non-responsive machines just time out of the RPC server on them is not
              available. Messy and rather inelegant. Need to add some way of handling them where
              they are flagged as non-respondive to the user, but no output is created

* Change:     Personalization of the basic reporting format.
  Rationale:  If a company wants to use this, it is entirely possible they would want to have
              their company logo or some other personalization of the reports.
